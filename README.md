data of permanent employment certification

This is story about permanent employment certification, my first project about data visualisation. I explored to create a wall of data, bar chart and something about transition, also combined with other libraries.

In this project, what I have learned is the process to tell a story.<br>
Find what you are interested in and what you care about, don't care too much if the data turns out to be on your opposite <br>side or be totally different with you imagine. Just do it.
<br>Then always remember to be honest, just show what you have found. And tell the story to your audiences, let them discover the truth themselves, you just control the direction. Don't be panic if the truth turns out to be surprising.
<br>Rethink the story, find deeper about your story, what you really want to let your audiences know about you and your project.

In this project, I also created a svg image by using meaningless data which I designed myself, it's like a Reverse Thinking about the relationship between data and visualization. If you are interested in that, please check another project named INDIA VS CANADA. Many thanks.
